# Double Connection

Connection of two data base

## Getting Started

Take for example the file "database.php" found in "config / database.php".

Then, take the ".env.example" file as an example.

Finally, take an example of models "Product.php" and "Category.php".

Create a local database called "sou_example_1" with the "products" table. Because I was local I did a migration

Create a server database called "categories" and "category_product".
